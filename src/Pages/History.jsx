        Our church was founded in 1990 with a small group of dedicated believers who sought to create a community centered around faith, love, and service. Over the years, we have grown into a vibrant congregation that welcomes everyone with open arms. Our mission has always been to spread the message of hope and compassion, and we continue to strive towards making a positive impact in our community and beyond.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-3 text-[16px] text-justify'>
        Through various outreach programs, worship services, and community events, we aim to embody the teachings of Christ and serve those in need. We are grateful for the journey so far and look forward to many more years of growth and service together.
